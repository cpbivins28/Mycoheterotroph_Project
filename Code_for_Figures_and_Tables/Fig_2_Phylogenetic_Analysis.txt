##### TOMENTELLA_TREE

### Make a phylogenetic tree of all my Thelephoraceae OTUs combined with Craig Barret's Tomentella fuscocinerea ITS sequences from C. striata plants collected throughout the Sierras (including Fresno and Madera counties)

## Download Barrett's sequences using accession IDs from 2010 paper Appendix 1:
# Make text file of accession ID's for bulk download
nano accession_ids.txt
# Copy and paste the accession ID's:

## Create biopython script for bulk download of sequences using entrez:

# copy and paste script in:

# Set the email address (required by NCBI)
Entrez.email = "cpqbivins@gmail.com"  

# Read the accession IDs from the file
with open("accession_ids.txt", "r") as f:
    accession_ids = f.read().strip().split("\n")

# Open the output file for writing
with open("sequences.fasta", "w") as output_fasta:
    for accession_id in accession_ids:
        # Fetch the sequence
        handle = Entrez.efetch(db="nucleotide", id=accession_id, rettype="fasta", retmode="text")
        
        # Parse the sequence
